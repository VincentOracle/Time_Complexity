2) If T(K-6) =89, find the value of K

To find the value of K when T(K-6) = 89, you can use the given recursive relation T(n) = T(n-2) + T(n-1) and work backward.

Given T(K-6) = 89, let's find T(K-5) using the same relation:

T(K-5) = T((K-6) - 2) + T((K-6) - 1) = T(K-8) + T(K-7)

Now, let's continue this process, finding T(K-4), T(K-3), T(K-2), and T(K-1):

T(K-4) = T(K-6) + T(K-5) = 89 + T(K-8) + T(K-7)
T(K-3) = T(K-5) + T(K-4) = T(K-8) + T(K-7) + 89 + T(K-8) + T(K-7)
T(K-2) = T(K-4) + T(K-3) = 89 + T(K-8) + T(K-7) + T(K-8) + T(K-7) + T(K-8) + T(K-7)
T(K-1) = T(K-3) + T(K-2) = (T(K-8) + T(K-7) + 89 + T(K-8) + T(K-7)) + (89 + T(K-8) + T(K-7) + T(K-8) + T(K-7) + T(K-8) + T(K-7))

Now, since we want to find K when T(K-6) = 89, we need to look for a pattern. Notice that T(K-8) and T(K-7) terms appear multiple times in the equations for T(K-2) and T(K-1). We can factor them out:

T(K-1) = 89 + T(K-8) + T(K-7) + 89 + (T(K-8) + T(K-7)) + (89 + T(K-8) + T(K-7))

We can see that T(K-1) can be expressed in terms of T(K-8) and T(K-7) repeatedly:

T(K-1) = 3 * (T(K-8) + T(K-7)) + 89

Now, if T(K-6) = 89, we can substitute this value:

89 = 3 * (T(K-8) + T(K-7)) + 89

Subtract 89 from both sides:

0 = 3 * (T(K-8) + T(K-7))

Now, if 3 times the sum of T(K-8) and T(K-7) is equal to zero, it implies that:

T(K-8) + T(K-7) = 0

Now, we need to find a positive integer K for which this equation holds true. Since we don't have more information about the initial conditions of the sequence, it's not possible to determine a unique value of K based on the provided information. The value of K would depend on the specific properties of the sequence.





the initial conditions are:
T(1) = 3
T(2) = 5

Thank you for providing the initial conditions. With T(1) = 3 and T(2) = 5, we can now determine the value of K when T(K-6) = 89.

We already established the following relationship:

T(K-8) + T(K-7) = 0

Now, let's use this relationship to find the value of K when T(K-6) = 89:

T(K-6) = T(K-8) + T(K-7)

Since T(K-8) + T(K-7) = 0, we have:

T(K-6) = 0 + 89
T(K-6) = 89

Now, you want to find the value of K when T(K-6) = 89, and we've just shown that this is the case. Therefore, K - 6 must be equal to 6 because when you subtract 6 from K, you get T(K-6), which is equal to 89. So:

K - 6 = 6

Add 6 to both sides:

K = 12

Therefore, K is equal to 12 when T(K-6) = 89.

now give a comprehensive answer once again

Certainly, here's a comprehensive answer to the question:

Given the recursive relation T(n) = T(n-2) + T(n-1) with the initial conditions T(1) = 3 and T(2) = 5, we want to find the value of K when T(K-6) = 89.

First, we can establish the relationship between T(K-8) and T(K-7):

T(K-8) + T(K-7) = 0

Next, we use this relationship to find T(K-6) as follows:

T(K-6) = T(K-8) + T(K-7)

Since T(K-8) + T(K-7) = 0, it simplifies to:

T(K-6) = 0 + 89
T(K-6) = 89

We've established that T(K-6) is equal to 89.

To find K, we equate K-6 to 6 because when you subtract 6 from K, you get T(K-6), which is equal to 89:

K - 6 = 6

Add 6 to both sides to isolate K:

K = 12

So, with the given initial conditions, K is equal to 12 when T(K-6) = 89.
